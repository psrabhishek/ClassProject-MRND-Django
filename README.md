- A 26 Days course Conducted in IIT-Hyderabad and it consists of 2 courses, Systems and Apps.
	
- In the Apps course, we learn developing full-stack applications with realtime database and RESTful API's.


# ClassProject

It is a [Django project](https://www.djangoproject.com/) developed during the Course. It is a Web Application for the student and college data of the students previous MRND Course students. The main objective of building this application was to learn the Django Framework, how do Full Stack applications work, how to debug a Django project and many more.

## DJDT

DJDT stands for Django Debug Tool Bar, which can be used to view all information in the web application from a tool bar. It contains everything from web requests to SQL query executed. We can also customize the DJDT to show data we want and in a required format, but it requires analyzing and modifying the DJDT source code.

## API's

Django-rest-framework was used to create rest API's for the web application. This included not just creation and usage of rest API's but also the authentication and authorization of the user calling the API's.
